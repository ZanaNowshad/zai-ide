# ZAI-IDE

## Project Overview
ZAI-IDE is an AI-Driven Integrated Development Environment designed to boost developer productivity by integrating advanced AI functionalities. It offers a powerful set of features to assist developers with real-time code generation, refactoring, collaboration metrics, and even quantum programming capabilities. This IDE aims to streamline workflows for both individual developers and collaborative teams.

## Key Features
1. **AI-Driven Code Generation and Refactoring**: Generate code snippets and receive AI-driven suggestions for improving or refactoring code.
2. **AI Chat Assistant**: Provides interactive AI assistance for coding queries, explanations of code snippets, and more.
3. **Code Collaboration Metrics**: Real-time collaboration metrics to improve teamwork and productivity.
4. **Quantum Programming Support**: Integrated Qiskit support for developing and simulating quantum algorithms.
5. **Terminal Integration**: Full-fledged terminal functionality, allowing developers to execute shell commands without leaving the IDE.
6. **Real-Time Cloud Deployment**: One-click deployment of projects to the cloud for real-time testing.
7. **Security Audit Assistance**: AI-driven security recommendations to prevent vulnerabilities.
8. **Customizable Plugin Architecture**: Extend the IDE's functionality with custom plugins to suit developer needs.
9. **Integrated Learning Modules**: AI-assisted learning modules provide educational guidance as developers work.

## Technology Stack
- **Electron**: Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Monaco Editor**: Provides a powerful code editing experience.
- **XTerm.js**: Terminal integration within the IDE.
- **Express.js**: Node.js backend to handle various services and routes.
- **OpenAI GPT API**: Core AI functionalities including code generation, security audits, and bug detection.
- **Qiskit**: Quantum programming support for advanced users.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying.

## Current Progress
**Completion Status**: 28% of the COMPLETE PRODUCTION READY PROJECT
