## Installation Instructions
### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version >= 14.0.0)
- **npm** (version >= 6.0.0)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ZanaNowshad/zai-ide.git
    cd zai-ide
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:
        ```
        OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
        ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    - To run the **frontend and backend**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Deployment
For **cloud deployment**, the IDE includes a built-in deployment feature that utilizes a script (`deploy_to_cloud.sh`) to simulate deployment. Make sure to adjust the script with your preferred cloud provider's CLI commands for an actual deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Electron**: Cross-platform desktop app framework.
- **React**: For frontend UI development.
- **Node.js**: Backend services.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication.
- **OpenAI API**: AI-powered features for code generation, refactoring, and learning assistance.
